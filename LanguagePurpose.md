# Language purpose/genesis

## Swift

### Why was the language created?
Apple needed something more resilient and concise than objective-c, dev work started in 2010 by Chris Lattner, the same author of the LLVM compiler. Released in June of 2014.
### What problems was the language trying to address?
Swift was developed to help address common errors like null pointers and provided some nice syntactic sugar to avoid pyramids of doom.
### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
Swift was the successor to the OBjective-C language, Swift for the Mac currently still runs in the Objective-C runtime but an open source version for Linux no longer runs or even ships with the Objective-C runtime.


## Java

### Why was the language created?
Java was started as a project called "Oak" by James Gosling in June 1991. Gosling's goals were to implement a virtual machine and a language that had a familiar C-like notation but with greater uniformity and simplicity than C/C++. 

### What problems was the language trying to address?
Java emphasis on speed

### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
